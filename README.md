# Competitive-Programming-Submissions

This folder contains the various submissions made on various competitive programming websites by me

Mostly, these are the ones that are not visible on websites like Uva or SPOJ as other submissions can be found on websites itself

I am not an expert on competitive programming, nor are these solutions the most optimal ones and you will find better solutions elsewhere

Most(if not all) solutions are in C++

My handle links on some competitive programming websites:
